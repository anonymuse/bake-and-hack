# Bake and Hack
## Containers Full of Pi

Containers. Containers full of Pi as far as the eye can see.

### Summary
Cutting edge container technology in 2016 is landing at full speed in production systems at both software companies and enterprise businesses. Hands-on understanding how distributed systems perform in clustered, real-world infrastructure and software-defined networks is fast becoming an essential dimension to leveraging container technology as a business differentiator.

In order to pressure test network fabrics, security controls, and container orchestration systems such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and ______, we’re going to build ourselves a big cluster. In fact, we’re going to have a handful of big iron switches on hand with as many ethernet cables as the eye can count. We’ll be bringing a box of Raspberry Pis and we ask that you bring one of your own.

Our goal? Build the largest Raspberry Pi cluster the world has ever seen, and then run Swarm and Kubernetes on it. We’ll divide up into teams:

- Networking
- Orchestration
- Security
- Hardware
- Automation
- Storage
- Application
- Legos

and see what it takes to run a hardware cluster of containerized applications at scale.
